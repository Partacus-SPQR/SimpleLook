# SimpleLook

**Look around freely while moving - inspired by Rust's free look feature.**

The keybind is **unbound by default**. Go to **Options > Controls > Key Binds > SimpleLook** and bind a key (we recommend **Left Alt**). Then hold the key and glance around without changing your movement direction. Works while running, flying, swimming, and more.

## Features

- **Free Look Camera** - Look around independently from movement
- **Smooth Animation** - Camera smoothly returns to center
- **Customizable Binding** - Rebind to any key or mouse button
- **Hold or Toggle Mode** - Your choice of activation style
- **Configurable Limits** - Set max horizontal/vertical angles
- **Works Everywhere** - Running, elytra, swimming, riding

## How to Use

1. Go to **Options > Controls > Key Binds > SimpleLook**
2. Bind "Free Look" to your preferred key (recommended: **Left Alt**)
3. Hold your bound key and move your mouse
4. Your camera rotates while your body keeps its direction
5. Release and the camera returns smoothly
